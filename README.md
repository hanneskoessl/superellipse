# Overlap criterion for superellipse
The information about the relative position of two hard particles is important in computer
simulations. In Monte Carlo method, it is important to avoid the overlap of these
particles when they are shifted. It is easy to solve this task for spherical particles. It
is more difficult to determine the overlap for elliptical particles, since the orientation of
the particles has to be taken into account. For ellipses, the Vielliard-Baron criterion can be used. This code gives a way to determine the overlap of superelliptical particles using the Sylvester matrix.
